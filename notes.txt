0 - Activate CDC on the database that needs to be moved. There is no need to support "net changes" so even tables without PK will work fine
1 - Start Debezium 0.10 on-prem and point it to an already created Event Hub with at least 7 days of retention
2 - Wait for 1 to finish (log will tell "Snapshot step 8 - Finalizing") and then create a database snapshot of the database that needs to be moved to HS
3 - Generate the database schema, without FK, and create an empty database in HS
4 - Export all data from database snapshot and BULK LOAD the data into HS. (More on this in a future email as there are some best practices and possible improvements also here)
5 - Once BULK LOAD is finished, create all FK on HS database
6 - Get the last LSN from the database snapshot take at 1 (sys.fn_cdc_get_max_lsn())
7 - Create/Execute an application that will consume data from EventHub and generate INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE commands for all transaction with commited lsn (it is a metadata stored in the pyload that Debezium creates) greater then the one found in 6.
8 - Leave the application running until the two database are in sync
9 - Stop database on-prem. Migration Done!

The step are in this sequence due to the fact that Debezium will monitor changes on from the LSN it finds when it performs its own "snapshot", which is actually skipped for VLDB via the provided json config file.
This means that to be sure not to lose any changes, debezium needs to be started (1) BEFORE the sql server database snapshot is taken (2).
During this amout of time, changes can be done to the database and they will end up in debezium AND in the database snapshot.
The last LSN of the database snapshot can be used int the replay tool to skip the transaction found in debezium that are already in the snapsho and thus in the HS database.
